# Practicum-Course-in-Image-Processing_M3
## Description
### Here are 4 assignments from Module 1 of the Practicum in Image Processing which create 4 projects in different .dpr files as follows:
#### * Practical Exercise 1 (ElemenWarna.dpr)
Practice 1 consists of a form (TForm) that contains several user interface components, including buttons (TButton), labels (TLabel), text boxes (TEdit), and images (TImage). In addition, there is also an image selection dialog (TOpenPictureDialog) for loading images into the application.
The purpose of this application is to allow the user to load an image into the application and know the color value (RGB) of the pixel clicked in the image. When the user clicks on a pixel in the image, the app will display the position of the clicked pixel along with the red (R), green (G), and blue (B) color values of the pixel.
So, this application is a simple application to load and display the color information of the loaded image, helping users to analyze and understand the color composition of the image.
#### * Practical Exercise 2 (Keabuan.dpr)
Practice 2 consists of a form (TForm) that has two buttons (TButton), two image objects (TImage), and an image selection dialog (TOpenPictureDialog).
The purpose of this application is to allow users to load an image from their file system and then generate a new image that is an average of the pixel colors in the original image. The "Load Image" button is used to load an image from the file system, while the "Average" button is used to calculate the average of the pixel colors in the loaded image and display it on the second image object.
So, this application is a simple application for manipulating images by calculating the average pixel color of the loaded image.
#### * Practical Exercise 3 (CitraNegatif.dpr)
Practice 3 consists of a form (TForm) that has a button (TButton), two image objects (TImage), and an image selection dialog (TOpenPictureDialog).
The purpose of this application is to allow users to load an image from their file system and then generate a negative image of the loaded image. When the user clicks the "Load Image" button, the application will load an image from the file system selected by the user, then generate a negative image of the image and display it on the second image object.
So, this application is a simple application for generating negative images from images loaded by the user.
#### * Post Test (Jmenu.dpr)
This Post Test consists of a form (TForm) that has two image objects (TImage), an image selection dialog (TOpenPictureDialog), and a menu (TMainMenu) that consists of several menu items (TMenuItem).
The purpose of this application is to allow users to load an image from their file system and then perform two types of operations on the image, namely converting the image to grayscale and generating a negative image of the original image.
So, this application is a simple application for manipulating images by converting them to grayscale or generating negative images from images loaded by the user.
